A utility for waiting for the next DOM update flush.

- **Type**

    `function nextTick(callback?: () => void): Promise<void>`

- **Details**

    When you mutate reactive state in Vue, the resulting DOM updates are not applied synchronously. Instead, Vue buffers them until the "next tick" to ensure that each component updates only once no matter how many state changes you have made.

    `nextTick()`Â can be used immediately after a state change to wait for the DOM updates to complete. You can either pass a callback as an argument, or await the returned Promise.
